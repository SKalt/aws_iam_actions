# aws_iam_actions

A dataset of (very nearly[^1]) all the AWS IAM actions scraped from [the AWS reference docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/reference.html).

## Notes on copyright

The scraped data should fall under US copyright fair-use since it copies only the facts of an API description and nothing else -- notably no human-readable documentation.
Please send any copyright complaints and takedown requests to <a href="mailto:dmca@kalt.cloud">dmca@kalt.cloud</a>.

Copying, modifying, and using the scraper itself is granted under a [ BSD-3-Clause license](./LICENSE).
